    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
